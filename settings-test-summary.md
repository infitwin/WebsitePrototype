2. **Clean console** - No JavaScript errors appearing
3. **Functional forms** - All form elements working properly
4. **Interactive elements** - Toggle switches and buttons responsive

### Remaining Issue to Address

**Settings Persistence Problem:**
- When page is refreshed, settings revert to default values
- Expected: Changed display name should persist
- Actual: Reverts to "John Doe" default
- Root cause: Settings not being properly saved to/loaded from localStorage

### Recommendations

1. ‚úÖ **Firebase imports are now working correctly** - No action needed
2. ‚úÖ **Basic functionality is operational** - Forms and toggles work
3. üîß **Fix persistence logic** - Settings should load from localStorage on page load
4. üîß **Verify localStorage save/load cycle** - Ensure changes are properly stored

### Technical Details

- **Server**: Running on http://localhost:8357
- **Test credentials**: weezer@yev.com / 123456
- **Firebase version**: v8.10.1 (compatibility mode)
- **Test coverage**: Login, navigation, form submission, toggles, persistence

### Conclusion

**MAJOR SUCCESS**: The Firebase import issues have been completely resolved. The settings page now loads without any JavaScript errors and all core functionality is working. The only remaining issue is the settings persistence, which is a separate implementation detail that can be addressed in the settings page JavaScript logic.
