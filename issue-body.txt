## Issue Summary
The Settings page navigation sidebar is not visually loading despite having proper infrastructure and passing Playwright tests.

## Expected Behavior
Settings page should show left sidebar with emoji navigation icons (Dashboard, Twin Management, etc.) as defined in /components/shared-sidebar.html

## Actual Behavior  
- Empty sidebar-nav-container div
- Navigation functionality works (tests pass)
- Visual sidebar not appearing

## Technical Details
- Settings page: http://localhost:8357/pages/settings.html
- Has sidebar-nav-container div (line 661)
- Loads navigation.js (line 1055) 
- shared-sidebar.html component exists and is accessible
- Playwright tests find all navigation elements

## Investigation Needed
- Check if navigation.js NavigationManager is loading shared sidebar properly
- Verify fetch request to ../components/shared-sidebar.html
- Test if path resolution works from /pages/settings.html
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

## Related Issues
- #61 (Navigation missing on Interview page)
- #59 (Navigation inconsistencies)

## Test Case
Run: npx playwright test tests/audit-settings.spec.js (passes despite visual issue)

## Priority
Medium - Navigation works functionally but missing visual elements impacts UX
