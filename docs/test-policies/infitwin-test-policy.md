## Test Execution Process

### 1. Pre-Development Testing
Before coding each page:
1. Review design requirements
2. Identify test scenarios
3. Set up test data
4. Create test checklist

### 2. During Development Testing
While building:
1. Test each feature as completed
2. Verify responsive behavior
3. Check accessibility basics
4. Console error monitoring

### 3. Post-Development Testing
After page completion:
1. Full functional test suite
2. Cross-browser verification
3. Performance audit
4. Accessibility scan
5. Integration testing

### 4. Pre-Release Testing
Before deployment:
1. End-to-end user flows
2. Load testing
3. Security review
4. Final visual QA

  // Check resend button
  const resendBtn = page.locator('button:has-text("Resend")');
  await expect(resendBtn).toBeDisabled();
  
  // Wait for timer
  await page.waitForTimeout(60000);
  await expect(resendBtn).toBeEnabled();
