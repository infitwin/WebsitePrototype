## Key Findings

### Working Interactive Elements
1. **Auth Page Tab System**: Fully functional tab switching between login/signup
2. **Dashboard Navigation**: Hover states and navigation structure working well
3. **Dashboard Action Buttons**: Proper hover effects and interactivity
4. **Settings Toggles**: Checkbox/toggle elements functioning correctly

### Issues Identified
1. **Auth Form Fields**: Missing or incorrectly identified form field selectors
2. **Missing Expected Elements**: Several pages don't have elements with expected class names
3. **Potential Implementation Gaps**: Some features may not be fully implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Auth Form Selectors**: Add proper ID attributes to email/password fields
2. **Document Element Selectors**: Create a reference of actual class names used
3. **Update Test Selectors**: Align test expectations with actual implementation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Add More Interactive Elements**:
   - Modal dialogs
   - Dropdown menus
   - Accordions/collapsibles
   - Tooltips
   - Loading states

2. **Improve Test Coverage**:
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Test touch interactions for mobile
   - Add accessibility testing
   - Implement visual regression testing

3. **Standardize Element Classes**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Document interactive element patterns
   - Create reusable component classes

## Test Artifacts
- **Screenshots**: Located in `/interactive-test-results/` directory
- **HTML Report**: `test_report_[timestamp].html` with visual comparisons
- **Python Test Script**: `test_interactive_elements.py` for reproduction
- **Results Viewer**: `view-interactive-test-results.html` for detailed analysis

## Conclusion
The Infitwin website has a solid foundation of interactive elements, with the main navigation and form systems working well. The primary areas for improvement are standardizing element selectors and completing the implementation of interactive features on pages like Memory Archive and File Browser. The auth page form field issue should be addressed as a priority since it affects core functionality.
