# CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Instructions

## PROJECT COLOR SCHEME

The Infitwin website uses a consistent color palette across all pages:

- **Primary Purple (Sidebar)**: #6B46C1 (deep purple)
- **Background**: #F3F4F6 (light gray)
- **Card Background**: #FFFFFF (white) with subtle shadows
- **Success/Progress Green**: #10B981
- **Warning/Accent Yellow**: #FFD700 (golden yellow)
- **Info/Action Blue**: #3B82F6
- **Error Red**: #EF4444
- **Text Primary**: #374151 (dark gray)
- **Text Secondary**: #6B7280 (medium gray)
- **Border Color**: #E5E7EB (light gray)

Always use these colors when implementing new features to maintain visual consistency.

## COMPRESSION INSTRUCTIONS

### Code: C1 (Coding Handoff)
To get this command, say: "Create the full /compact command with C1 instructions text"

When I use `/compact C1`, use these compression instructions:

Focus on: current build plan status with verification results, exact current step and next command to run, working file:line and function, last attempt and result, all credential locations, service ports with start commands, test/verification commands, tools/dashboard URLs, test data examples, rollback commit/version, warnings about critical operations. CRITICAL: Include all uncommitted code changes, unpushed commits, and pending deployments (Firebase, Cloud Build, etc.) to prevent losing work between compressions. Preserve the problem-solving position, not just project description.

## MEMORY COMPRESSION HANDOFF SUMMARY

When you are about to reach memory limits or need to compress context, create an inline summary using this exact format:

```
=== MEMORY COMPRESSION HANDOFF ===

TASK: Build Infitwin Phase 1 Alpha - 8 of 10 pages complete, starting Phase 4

BUILD PLAN:
[x] Step 1: Phase 1 Authentication Flow | VERIFIED: Email Verification & Alpha Welcome pages with corrective snapshots
[x] Step 2: Phase 2 Core Features | VERIFIED: File Browser, Twin Management, Settings all complete
[x] Step 3: Phase 3 Enhanced Experience | VERIFIED: Explore Screen & Talk to Twin with full functionality
[>] Step 4: [CURRENT: Phase 4 Sharing & Error Handling]
    Next: Create pages/shared-view.html with read-only twin viewer
    Verify: curl http://localhost:8080/pages/shared-view.html returns 200
    Expect: Limited navigation, read-only graph, owner attribution
    If fail: Check file paths and permissions
[ ] Step 5: General Error Page | Verify: Friendly error handling

CURRENT CONTEXT:
Working on: Phase 4, Task 4.1 Shared View
Function: Read-only twin viewing for shared access
Problem: None - Phase 3 complete and pushed
Last attempt: Successfully completed Talk to Twin screen with chat interface

CREDENTIALS:
- Service Account: None needed (local development)
- API Keys: Integration points documented for future
- Env vars needed: None currently
- Auth token: Not required for static pages

TOOLS/INTERFACES:
- Development Server: http://localhost:8080 (python3 -m http.server 8080)
- Explore Screen: http://localhost:8080/pages/explore.html âœ…
- Talk to Twin: http://localhost:8080/pages/talk-to-twin.html âœ…
- Master Work List: /docs/build-plans/master-work-list.md
- GitHub: github.com:infitwin/WebsitePrototype.git

VERIFICATION COMMANDS:
- Test page: curl http://localhost:8080/pages/[page].html
- Check responsive: Browser DevTools with corrective snapshots
- Git status: git status && git log --oneline -5
- Server check: ps aux | grep 'python.*8080'

SERVICES/PORTS:
- 8080: HTTP server - start: python3 -m http.server 8080
- Required external: None (all APIs marked for future integration)

TEST DATA:
- Twin name: "John's Digital Twin"
- Shared twins: Margaret Johnson, Robert Smith examples
- Storage: 3.5GB of 10GB used
- Files: Drag-drop with 50MB limit

UNCOMMITTED/UNPUSHED CODE:
- Modified files: None (all committed)
- New files created: None pending
- Git status: Clean working tree
- Latest commits: 827678c (Talk to Twin), 9b41e0b (Explore), dbf3334 (Phase 2)
- Firebase deploy needed: None (static files)
- Cloud Build needed: None

WARNINGS:
- ðŸ“¸ CRITICAL: Mandatory corrective snapshot process must continue
- Test files exist but excluded from commits (dashboard-emotional-montecarlo.html, etc)
- Neo4j and Winston AI integrations are placeholders only
- All API endpoints marked but not implemented

ROLLBACK:
- Last working commit: 827678c (Phase 3 complete)
- Safe version: All phases tested and working
- Rollback command: git reset --hard 827678c

RESUME CHECKLIST:
1. cd /home/tim/WebsitePrototype
2. Ensure server running: python3 -m http.server 8080
3. export: No env vars needed
4. Verify Phase 3 complete: All pages loading correctly
5. Continue with Phase 4: Shared View (Read-Only)

=== END HANDOFF ===
```

**IMPORTANT**: Create this summary inline in the chat when memory is getting full. Do not save it as a file. This ensures the compressed AI can immediately see and use it.
